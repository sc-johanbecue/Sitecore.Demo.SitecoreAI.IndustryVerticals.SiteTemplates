Located in the Spanish region of Castilla y LeÃ³n, it will be one of the largest e-methanol production plants in Europe, planned to be online by the end of 2027.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe facility will be one half of an integrated green energy generation project called La Robla Green. This project is made up of two cutting-edge facilities: \u003cstrong\u003eRoblum\u003c/strong\u003e, a green energy generation plant that will power more than 50,000 households - and \u003cstrong\u003eLa Robla NE\u003c/strong\u003e, an e-methanol plant. La Robla NE blends the COâ‚‚ extracted from the biomass plant with green hydrogen to produce e-methanol, with the expectation of up to 140 kt/year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor JM\u0027s Catalyst Technologies business, the Reolum project represents the fifth win since 1st April 2024 contributing to JM\u0027s strategic milestone of 20 sustainable technologies project wins by the end of 2025/26. Together with previously announced wins, including ETFuels\u0027 planned methanol plant in Texas announced in December 2024, JM has won 15 major energy transition projects since 1st April 2022. JM continues to win complex and ground-breaking energy transition projects providing the critical technology and licensing that enables our customers to power the energy transition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eE-methanol is an increasingly important product in decarbonising two hard to abate sectors â€“the chemicals industry and heavy transport, like shipping. The project is supported by the European Investment Bank and a Final Investment Decision is expected in 2025. Reolum is a Spanish firm specialising in the development of projects aimed at driving the energy transition and achieving decarbonisation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlberto Giovanzana, Managing Director, Catalyst Technologies Licencing, said:\u003c/strong\u003e \"Johnson Matthey\u0027s technology is leading the way in how heavy industries will be able to decarbonise in the coming years. Our eMERALD process and catalyst efficiently convert renewable resources into e-methanol. We\u0027re delighted to hit another of our milestones, working alongside Reolum on a transformational project for the region.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
