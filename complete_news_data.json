Although group free cash flow in the first half is expected to be an outflow, we expect to report a significant year-on-year improvement in the first half (1H 2024/25: £169 million outflow¹). As we further embed our working capital improvement measures, we expect a material step up in free cash flow for the full year when compared to the prior year (2024/25: £59 million inflow¹).</p><p>The group outlook for the full year (excluding Catalyst Technologies and Value Businesses) is at the higher end of our initial guidance of mid single digit growth in underlying operating profit².

Automotive platinum use is forecast to contract by 5%, from a sixteen-year high in 2024, as battery electric powertrains take market share in both the car and truck markets.</p><p><strong>Palladium</strong> was in persistent deficit between 2012 and 2024 but is predicted to move into balance this year. Operational restructuring will impact primary supply from South Africa and the USA, but robust growth in Chinese automotive recycling will boost secondary supply, despite weak scrap volumes in other regions. Lower production of gasoline vehicles is predicted to cut automotive palladium demand by 5%. The weak outlook for the auto market has also impacted investor sentiment and is curtailing investment demand.</p><p><strong>Rupen Raithatha, Market Research Director at Johnson Matthey, commented</strong>: \"It's a real challenge to predict PGM demand in 2025, in view of uncertainty over US import tariffs and potential retaliatory actions by trade partners. The most obvious impact will be in the auto sector. We're already expecting PGM use on vehicles to fall by 5% this year, but there's a further downside risk if tariffs result in cuts to vehicle production.\"</p></div>"

The site will be one of the largest such plants currently planned in the US and the biomethanol will primarily be for use as marine fuel, but can also be used as a feedstock for SAF production and the wider chemicals industry.</p><p>It is expected to produce more than 500,000 metric tonnes of biomethanol every year; the equivalent of powering up to 9 of some of the largest oceangoing container vessels today. SunGas Renewables has now announced the start of front-end engineering design (\"FEED\") –being carried out byKiewit and Jacobs Engineering -marking the beginning of the final stage of development for the project.</p><p>JM has been selected as a key technology partner providing methanol synthesis technology and catalysts.JM's methanol technology converts syngas from biomass gasification into biomethanol, effectively managing impurities from the upstream gasification process. The technology is well proven at scale and combines JM's methanol synthesis loop with a highlyeffective methanol synthesis catalyst delivering sustained, high feedstock efficiency while enhancing operational performance.</p><p><strong>Alberto Giovanzana, Managing Director Licencing, said:</strong>\"This is JM's first biomethanol licence win in the US and there will be more to come.We're excited to support SunGas Renewables' plans to transform an old industrial site, bringing real economic benefits to the area - with our world-leading methanol synthesis technology playing its part. Once operational, this large-scale production facility is destined to help meet the growing demand for low carbon biofuels in the years ahead.\"</p></div>"
